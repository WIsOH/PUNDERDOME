stick in the mud
sticks and stones may break my bones
sticky wicket
stiff upper lip
stiffen the sinews
stinking rich
stitch in time saves nine
stone the crows
stony hearted
stool pigeon
storm in a teacup
straight as a die
strain at the leash
strait laced
strait and narrow
stranger danger
stranger than fiction

surf and turf
survival of the fittest
suspension of disbelief
swan song
sweet fanny adams
swing for you
swing the lead
tail wagging the dog
take a back seat
take down a peg or two
take potluck
take the bit between your teeth
take the cake
take the gilt off the gingerbread
take the mickey
take the upper hand
take umbrage
take with a grain of salt
taken aback
talk of the devil
talk the talk
talk to the hand
tall story
tattoo phrases and sayings
tawdry
tea leaf
technicolor yawn

tempest in a teapot
the apple of my eye
the back of beyond
the balance of power
the balance of trade
the bane of my life
the belle of the ball
the best laid schemes of mice and men
the big apple
the big easy
the birds and the bees
the bitter end
the blind leading the blind
the bread of life
the buck stops here
the call of the wild
the camera cannot lie
the chickens come home to roost
the collywobbles
the course of true love never did run smooth
the crack of doom
the crapper
the customer is always right
the cut of your jib
the dark side
the darkest hour is just before the dawn
the devil incarnate
the devil take the hindmost
the devil to pay
the die has been cast
the early bird catches the worm
the elephant in the room
the ends of the earth
the exception which proves the rule
the face that launched a thousand ships
the fat of the land
the female of the species is more deadly then the male
the floozie in the jacuzzi
the fly in the ointment
the full monty
the game is afoot
the game is up
the great unwashed
the hair of the dog that bit you
the hairy eyeball
the heebie jeebies
the jury is still out
the land of nod
the last straw
the law is an ass
the life of riley
the living daylights
the love that dare not speak its name
the moving finger writes
the nth degree
the pen is mightier than the sword
the pip
the pot calling the kettle black
the powers that be
the proof of the pudding is in the eating
the quick and the dead
the real mccoy
the road less travelled
the salt of the earth
the seven year itch
the short end of the stick
the smallest room in the house
the tail wagging the dog
the toast of the town
the third degree
the triumph of hope over experience
the upper hand
the usual suspects
the whole kit and caboodle
the whole nine yards
the whole shebang
the writing is on the wall
the year dot
the yellow peril
there is more than one way to kill a cat
there is no alternative
thick and thin
thin air
thing of beauty is a joy forever
things that go bump in the night
think outside the box
thinking cap
third degree
third time lucky
thorn in the flesh
thou shalt not kill
three score and ten
three sheets to the wind
three strikes and you are out
through thick and thin
throw in the towel
throw your hat into the ring
thumbs up
thus far into the bowels of the land
ticked off

time and tide wait for no man
tilting at windmills
tissue of lies

tit for tat
tits up

to all intents and purposes
to beggar belief
to big for your breeches
to boldly go where no man has gone before
to boot
to cast the first stone
to the manner born
to the nth degree
to travel hopefully is a better thing than to arrive
